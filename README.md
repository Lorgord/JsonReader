Test task for Unreal Engine

Required:

Write an application that allows you to click on buttons in a scene and get data from
external table using the Unreal engine and C++ game engine.
Description:

1. In the scene, create 6 buttons with text from 1 to 6 and the “Update” button.

2. Write a code that, when you press a button, will display a certain
meaning.
Create a file with a two-dimensional array in .json format
The value displayed on the screen is taken from this external file.
Example: let’s say buttons 1 and 2 were pressed – the value from the external array is displayed on the screen
under the index [1,2].

3. When you click on the “Update” button, the values from the file with the latest
changes.
That is, if you change the values in the array indices and save the json file, then when updating,
we will get new values from the updated file.

4. Scripts must be written in C++ in compliance with SOLID principles

5. As a result, provide the source and versions for Linux and Windows for testing and a link to
repository with the project on github
